Huntsville police responded to a shooting at Benchwarmer early Sunday morning.

Officers responded to the shooting at the University Drive business around 12:40 a.m. Upon arrival, officers said they saw multiple juvenile shooting victims, who were transported to Huntsville Hospital with non-life threatening injuries.



Police said an offender, a juvenile, was taken into custody at the scene. Madison County Sheriff Deputies said he is being held at the juvenile detention center.

The offender's name has not been released. The investigation is ongoing.

Huntsville City Councilman Will Culver expressed concerns about the bar, which is located in his district.

"How did juveniles get into the facility?" Culver asked. "How did they get access to weapons? When you have places where alcohol is being served and you have guns, that is a recipe for disaster."



He believes the shooting was preventable and warrants a review of the business by taking a look at a history of events there.

"We certainly don't want to prejudge anyone, but to me, this was just the straw that broke the camel's back," Culver said. "We've had incidents here before. I am certainly going to be talking to our liquor license review committee to see what it is that we can do to keep our citizens safe."

Culver said he is open to discussing the bar's future with its owner, but he hasn't spoken with him yet. He plans to schedule a review with the liquor license review committee on Monday.
