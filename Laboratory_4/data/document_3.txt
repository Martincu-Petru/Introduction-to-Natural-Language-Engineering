A 16-year-old boy has been charged with killing a 17-year-old in Ford Heights following a dispute Wednesday, authorities said.

Paris Walker, of the south suburb, was ordered held without bail in a hearing today before Cook County Judge Darron Bowdown in Markham Branch Court after being charged as an adult with murder in the slaying of Malik McMillian, of Chicago Heights, according to the Cook County state’s attorney’s office.

McMillian and Walker had a dispute on the street and in the back yard of a home in the 1400 block of Ambassador Lane in Ford Heights about 7:35 p.m. Wednesday, and McMillian tried to leave, trying to climb over a chain-link fence, when he was shot, prosecutors said.

When McMillian fell to the ground after the first shots were fired, Walker stood over him and shot McMillian several more times, then fled the scene, prosecutors said.

McMillian, who also had an address in the 16000 block of Shea Avenue in Hazel Crest, was pronounced dead on the scene at 8:07 p.m. Wednesday, according to the Cook Count medical examiner's office.

An autopsy performed Thursday determined that he died as a result of multiple gunshot wounds.
